driver_data
- driver ID is unique for every row

sensor_data
- There are multiple rows with same bookingID
- The number of seconds is unique within each bookingID

safety_labels
- The bookingID is unique for each row
- There are multiple rows with same driver ID


Logic:
- A driver can have multiple bookings
- Each booking must belong to only one driver
- Each booking can have multiple sensor data
- Each sensor data must belong to only one booking
- Each booking sensor data have a unique number of seconds
