accuracy
https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/
- GPS accuracy is a radius of how close the calculated position is to the actual position of the receiver
- Average accuracy is 4.9m under open sky, accuracy worsens under buildings, bridges, and trees
- GPS accuracy can be improved using dual-frequency receivers and/or augmentation systems

bearing
- Bearing is the direction the receiver is facing relative to true north in degrees, where north is 0 degrees
- Bearing is in clockwise direction from north (NESW)

speed
- the speed of the receiver (meters per second)

second
- the second which the data was collected (assuming that 0s is the start of the ride, where gps receiver is turned on)

accelerometer data
- Useful: https://www.explainthatstuff.com/accelerometers.html
- "An accelerometer is a device that measures the vibration, or acceleration of motion of a structure" - https://www.omega.com/en-us/resources/accelerometers
- accelerometer data is collected from the phone's accelerometer sensor (assumption made here)
- accelerometer can sense only the change of the speed
- accelerometer uses F=ma to calculate the acceleration of the phone
