accuracy
https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/
- GPS accuracy is a radius of how close the calculated position is to the actual position of the receiver
- Average accuracy is 4.9m under open sky, accuracy worsens under buildings, bridges, and trees
- GPS accuracy can be improved using dual-frequency receivers and/or augmentation systems

bearing
- Bearing is the direction the receiver is facing relative to true north in degrees, where north is 0 degrees
- Bearing is in clockwise direction from north (NESW)

speed
- the speed of the receiver (meters per second)

second
- the second which the data was collected (assuming that 0s is the start of the ride, where gps receiver is turned on)

accelerometer data
- Useful: https://www.explainthatstuff.com/accelerometers.html
- "An accelerometer is a device that measures the vibration, or acceleration of motion of a structure" - https://www.omega.com/en-us/resources/accelerometers
- accelerometer data is collected from the phone's accelerometer sensor (assumption made here)
- accelerometer can sense only the change of the speed
- accelerometer uses F=ma to calculate the acceleration of the phone 
- it is affected by gravity
- use sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) to calculate the MAGNITUDE of the acceleration (https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/41653/how-do-i-get-the-total-acceleration-from-3-axes)

gyroscope
- measures angular velocity in radians/s (angular velocity is rate of change of angular position on rotating body)
- IDEA: y-axis of gyroscope can be used to determine if a car is rolling over, (high angular velocity)
